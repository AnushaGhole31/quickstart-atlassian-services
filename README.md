## Atlassian Standard Infrastructure on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start sets up the Atlassian Standard Infrastructure (ASI) in your AWS account in about 20 minutes. ASI is a highly available, secure virtual private cloud (VPC) that is specifically customized to host Atlassian Data Center products. 

The ASI includes two public and two private subnets in two Availability Zones in your AWS account, and contains all the components required for the deployment and integration of multiple Atlassian Data Center products within the same VPC.

The [Jira](https://fwd.aws/kRapJ), [Confluence](https://fwd.aws/JAEM9), and [Bitbucket](https://fwd.aws/BBeJW) Quick Starts all require the ASI.

For architectural details, best practices, step-by-step instructions, and customization options, see the
